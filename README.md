Are you a home baker searching for a reliable tool to keep track of your orders?
CakeCollate promises to be an efficient desktop application that allows you to easily consolidate and manage your orders. Our main features include:<br>
1. Order management
2. Order Item management
3. Quick search function for your orders
4. Reminder for undelivered orders that have delivery dates approaching the current date
5. Checking the delivery status of your orders

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you're a small-time cake seller that can type fast, CakeCollate can get your order management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.
